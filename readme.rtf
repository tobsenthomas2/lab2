\f0\fs24 \cf0 How to use motor controller with step response plotting:\
\
To use this motor controller, run the main function and input the desired angle (in encoder ticks), and the desired Kp value. Depending on your motor this value may have to be adjusted. Plotting the step response can help to see if your Kp value is making your system under or over damped. To plot the response, run the readAndPlotOnPC.py program, with your computer attached to the ST-LINK on the micro controller. Ensure that the port is set to the correct USB terminal on your computer. This is in addition to the cable you have set up to run micropython on the micro controller. Now run the main program and wait for the motion to stop. The plot should appear in the window of your read and plot program.}
